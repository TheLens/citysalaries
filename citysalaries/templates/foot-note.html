        Note: An employee's annual salary is the budgeted amount, and therefore does not include additional money such as overtime pay. However, it might include longevity pay, temporary pay, supplemental pay or special rates of pay. View the city's <a href="TODO: Dummy link until we get the document and upload to DocumentCloud" target="_blank">pay plan</a> for more information about these types of income.
